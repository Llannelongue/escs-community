And just like that, 2025 went by and we are now in December. We hope it has been a fruitful year for everyone in the ESCS Community. For this final newsletter release for year, we’re rounding up the latest news from the ESCS Forum since late November. We’ll be taking a break for the next few weeks and be back for the first release of 2026 in early February.

Until then, we encourage you to share any green computing news, resources, or questions on the ESCS Community Forum. And any suggestions to make this newsletter better, let us know!

### November-December Recap of the ESCS Community Forum

**News & Resources 📰**

- **Multinational companies and US government departments are quietly removing climate-related language on their websites.** News outlets have covered various companies like Meta removing statements about their climate commitments over the past few months. Just a few days ago, the US Environmental Protection Agency have omitted information on their website about humans being the drivers of climate change, leaving its discussion as a natural phenomena. <br>

- **Leaked data from 2023 suggests Amazon was operating 900+ data centres around the world (well over 2x the previous estimates), with many more in development.** [Report from SourceMaterial](https://www.source-material.org/amazon-data-centres-energy-water-usage) highlights that Amazon has a much higher number of data centres in operation across 50+ countries than what was publicly known. What does this mean? The carbon footprint and environmental impact of these data centres is very likely to much, much higher than what we have been previously estimating. <br>
