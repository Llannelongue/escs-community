We’re back with the third release of the ESCS newsletter!

Here is the monthly round up of the highlights from the forum last August, with news and resources to job openings and funding opportunities. As always, we invite you and your group to engage with the community by starting a new topic or chiming into one.

If you have ideas, let us know how we can make things even more relevant and useful to what you’re interested in and looking for in the green computing space. We’re all ears! And if someone has forwarded this newsletter to you and you're interested to receive more, you can [subscribe here](https://zcmp.eu/oRye).

### August Recap of the ESCS Community Forum

**News & Resources 📰**

- **[Data centre developers in the UK are looking to connect new facilities to main gas pipelines.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/data-centre-developers-in-the-uk-are-looking-to-connect-new-facilities-to-main-gas-pipelines/196)** Energy demand from upcoming data centres will be pushing carbon emissions upwards around the world, regardless of interest from big tech companies to curb CO2 emissions. For England in particular, developers are looking to power new data centres using the main gas pipelines to help supply power to new facilities quicker. The same thing is happening in the US and more than 85 other gas-powered facilities are in the works around the world. <br>

- **[Carbon-aware scheduling tools.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/data-centre-developers-in-the-uk-are-looking-to-connect-new-facilities-to-main-gas-pipelines/196)** From the July issue of Communications of the ACM, the [Putting Carbon on the Clock](https://cacm.acm.org/news/putting-carbon-on-the-clock) article highlights carbon-aware scheduling tools (including open-source options) and how these have helped reduce the environmental impact of some universities in Sweden and the US. Has your team used carbon-aware scheduling tools? How was it impacted your work? <br>

- **[Would energy hungry AI ever truly be green?](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/ft-series-on-whether-energy-hungry-ai-ever-truly-be-green/188)** The [second of the Financial Times’ three-part series](https://www.ft.com/content/9e0f8c64-9686-4551-8725-9cf268513b1e) on the environmental impact of AI highlights that almost a fifth of the gas power capacity in development in the US will be used to power data centres, more than 50% of data centre power will be from fossil fuels, and in Ireland, data centre demand for power took up more than a fifth of the whole country’s supply, with expectations to take up to a third in 2026. <br>

- **[Old power plants around Europe will be repurposed into data centres to support the AI boom.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/old-power-plants-around-europe-will-be-repurposed-into-data-centres-to-support-the-ai-boom/191)** More on the AI boom, Reuters has reported that many old power plants across Europe are in plans to be converted into data centres by big tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon. While majority of the power supply should come from renewables, we can still expect the surge in the demand to push fossil fuel consumption in the region. <br>

**Q&A Discussions 💬**

- We mentioned last month that we had a question from Laura Wilkinson about open access resources for green computing training. Thanks to Liz Ing-Simmons for chiming in and sharing links for the [Green Software Practitioner course](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/) and a workshop on [Green HPC system use](https://epcced.github.io/2025-07-02_GreenHPC_UCL). Does your group have other resources to contribute to the thread? <br>
