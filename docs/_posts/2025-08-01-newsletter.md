As we enter into October, we‚Äôre back with the September release of the ESCS newsletter!

Every month, we highlight news, tools, and resources in the intersection of environmental sustainability and computational science. From project announcements and policy developments to jobs and funding opportunities, we‚Äôre rounding up the latest that we think the community would find interesting and useful.

To keep things relevant, we want to hear from you! We encourage you to engage with the community on the ESCS Forum, chime into a topic, or start your own thread. And of course, any suggestions to make our newsletter even better, let us know.

### September Recap of the ESCS Community Forum

**News & Resources üì∞**

- **[Measuring and awarding data centre sustainability.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/measuring-and-awarding-data-centre-sustainability/198) Some more positive news on the data centre front:**
  - [This article](https://dcnnmagazine.com/build/sustainability/why-data-centres-should-care-about-atmospheric-chemistry/) argues for more holistic data centre sustainability, accounting for other atmospheric emissions including chemicals and metals aside from CO2, as these can lead to secondary pollutants when interacting with one another.
  - Did you know data centres can receive awards for sustainability? The Green Building Initiative (GBI) awarded its Green Globe for New Construction certification to tech infra company Aligned Data Centers for its latest data centre facility in Phoenix, USA, noting the facility‚Äôs strategies for reduced water usage, efficient cooling, 100% renewable power, and Adaptive Modular Infrastructure (AMI) which cuts down on scope 3 emissions ([link](https://dcnnmagazine.com/build/sustainability/aligneds-phoenix-data-centre-earns-three-green-globes/)). <br>

- **[From IEEE Spectrum: The Real Story on AI‚Äôs Water Use‚Äìand How to Tackle It > Cutting AI water use means smarter cooling and less thirsty grids.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/from-ieee-spectrum-the-real-story-on-ai-s-water-use-and-how-to-tackle-it-cutting-ai-water-use-means-smarter-cooling-and-less-thirsty-grids/206)** [Article from University of California Associate Professor Shaolei Ren and Microsoft‚Äôs AI and Sustainability Lead Amy Luers](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-water-usage) discusses how regions with high concentration of data centres are actually impacted by water shortages, and what are some of the available solutions. <br>

- **[What big tech data centre development looks like for countries like Mexico: ‚Äútemporary‚Äù reliance on gas generators.](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/what-big-tech-data-centre-development-looks-like-for-countries-like-mexico-temporary-reliance-on-gas-generators/207)** Rest of the World article on how big tech is powering the rapid expansion of data centres around the world. Because many national power grids face or will face a deficit, companies are resorting to gas. And even if this was truly a temporary power source, we still see that nearly 60% of electricity used around the world comes from fossil fuels ([link](https://restofworld.org/2025/ai-energy-supply-data-centers/)). <br>

- **[Fastest supercomputer from Germany and new open-source LLM in Switzerland - is running on renewables enough?](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/fastest-supercomputer-from-germany-and-new-open-source-llm-in-switzerland-is-running-on-renewables-enough/213)** These two projects are both advertising that they run on 100% renewable energy - [Jupiter](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02981-1) paying to only use renewables from Germany‚Äôs grid, and [Apertus](https://www.engadget.com/ai/switzerland-launches-its-own-open-source-ai-model-133051578.html) on Switzerland‚Äôs, making both models, on paper, carbon-neutral. But is that really enough to erase potential negative environmental impacts, given the scale of their power demand? <br>

**Q&A Discussions üí¨**

- **[Environmentally Sustainable HeAlth REsearch (SHARE) is looking for researchers!](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/looking-for-researchers-to-support-our-research/205)** The SHARE project, led by Dr Gabby Samuel (King's College London) and Dr Federica Lucivero (University of Oxford), are recruiting health researchers from the UK to be interviewed on environmental tools such as carbon accounting methods and accreditation systems. These will be 45-60 minute interviews, and participants will receive a ¬£20 voucher as a token of appreciation. Check the [online form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=FM9wg_MWFky4PHJAcWVDVkCsYA_vCs1Oi2M2QJgqhG5UMFMyNkdMTkRBSVBQSkc5RVJNRk9RVkpGQi4u&route=shorturl) to learn more. <br>

- We had a question in the forum last year from Andrew Walker on what the per CU estimate of the CO2 cost of running calculations on ARCHER2 is. Thanks to Andy Turner for chiming into the discussion (20g CO2e per CU if you‚Äôre curious!) and sharing a [resource](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/energy/#emissions). <br>
