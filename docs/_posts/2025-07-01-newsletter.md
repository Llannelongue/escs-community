Hi all,

Hopefully summer has been going well for everyone - either you‚Äôre enjoying your holidays or catching up with the slow down (ideally those are mutually exclusive!).

Coming from our first newsletter last month, we‚Äôre back for another one this July with the latest from the forum. Any feedback on this monthly digest, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out at [contact@escs-community.org](contact@escs-community.org). We‚Äôd love to hear from you!
