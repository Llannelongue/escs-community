We’re back with the October recap of the ESCS Community Forum and it’s a lengthy one! It has been a lively month on the forum, with more engagement and posts from our members. From resources to job openings and helpful discussions on Green DiSC, here is a recap of what’s been going on.

As always, if you have exciting news to share or have a pressing question on sustainable computing, the ESCS Community Forum is the place to go. And if you have any suggestions to make our newsletter better, we’d love to hear it.

### October Recap of the ESCS Community Forum

**News & Resources 📰**

- **Transparency in climate impacts and preventing green washing.** Andy Turner contributes the book [Climate of Truth](https://climateoftruth.co.uk/) in a thread on the ESCS Forum, discussing how organisations like oil companies, commercial cloud companies, and governments can report with more honesty and fight greenwashing. <br>

**Upcoming Events 🎟️**

- **Call for participants! Online co-design workshops to improve the design of carbon calculators.** Researchers from the University of Cambridge, Lancaster University, and Université Paris-Saclay will be running two co-design workshops in December 2025 to improve the design of carbon calculators for computing activities, such as the [Green Algorithms calculator](https://calculator.green-algorithms.org/). They are looking for participants with an interest in the topic who have used the Green Algorithms calculator or other carbon reporting tools. The workshops will be conducted online, and no design experience is required. More information and sign-up [here](https://www.green-algorithms.org/co-design_workshop/). <br>

**Q&A Discussions 💬**

- We have a question from JoeNardo in the forum, who is working on a computational inventory for their lab. For anyone with experience here, can you share tips or resources on how to quantify the efficiency of cloud based automation? <br>
    👉 *[Join the discussion on the forum](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/sustainability-metrics-for-cloud-based-automation/225)*

- We had a question from DawnG in the forum asking for contacts to managers of HPC and data centres to better understand impact on water resources. We had a very helpful response from Liz Ing-Simmons for [Tier 2/3 HPC documentation sites from the CCP-AHC](https://www.ccpahc.ac.uk/resources/sites/#hpc-documentation-sites). <br>
