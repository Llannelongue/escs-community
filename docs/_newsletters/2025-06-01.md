Hi all,

Welcome to the first monthly digest of the ESCS Community! We thank you for your patience as it took some time to get things up and running on our side. We‚Äôre catching up and excited to roll this out on a monthly basis.

**This newsletter aims to be a round up of interesting news and developments in the sustainable computing space. The concept is simple: whenever we come across an interesting news item or publication on the topic, we will post it [on the forum](https://forum.escs-community.org/) (e.g. in the [news category](https://forum.escs-community.org/c/news/11)) so that everyone can jump in and discuss it; but of course, this is a collaborative effort and you are all encouraged to share what catches your eye! At the end of each month, we will send out this monthly digest of the articles shared and of the discussions that happened on the forum.**

### Let's dive in: what's new in green compute? üå± üì∞
Starting with just a few items before the summer‚Ä¶
- ‚Äú‚Ä¶it‚Äôs likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be.‚Äù MIT Tech Review‚Äôs overview of AI‚Äôs environmental footprint sheds light on the impact of the biggest models today and makes the case for more (and better) disclosures from companies [[link](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech), [ESCS forum post](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/from-the-mit-tech-review-we-did-the-math-on-ai-s-energy-footprint-here-s-the-story-you-haven-t-heard/174)]
- In the US, the EPA released a new 50-hour rule, allowing back up generators in data centres ‚Äî which mostly use fossil fuel ‚Äî to operate for up to 50 hours a year [[EPA article](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-issues-clarification-help-power-data-centers-ensure-us-ai-capital-world), [LinkedIn post discussing it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shaolei-ren-68557415_epa-issues-clarification-to-help-power-data-activity-7344445299416801280-qYnr)]
- Training a model equates to the emissions of five cars; using ChatGPT is 10x more energy intensive than Googling; we can reduce global emissions by 10% with AI. How (in)accurate are these numbers? Sasha Luccioni, Boris Gamazaychikov, Theo Alves da Costa, and Emma Strubell look into misinformation surrounding the environmental sustainability of AI and how we can do better [[link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15572), [ESCS forum post](https://forum.escs-community.org/t/misinformation-by-omission-the-need-for-more-environmental-transparency-in-ai/173)]

And we will be back with more next month!
